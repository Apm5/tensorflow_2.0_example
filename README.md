### This is an example for tensorflow 2.0-alpha

In version 2.0, many features of tensorflow are deleted or changed, such as `tf.Session`. And in new version, Keras became the core function, which makes the code style quite different from before.

In this project, I will implement various layers and models. And I will try not to rely on advanced APIs to make it easy to change the details of the model.

Models and layers are as follows:

#### DONE:

Reimplement fully connected layer

Reimplement convolution layer

Use unofficial evaluation and loss function

use unofficial train function

#### TODO:

tf.data

Batch normalization

Gabor convolution

LSTM

VGG

ResNet

RCNN series
